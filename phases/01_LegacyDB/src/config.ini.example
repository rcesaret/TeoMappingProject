# ============================================================================
#         Configuration File for Digital TMP Phase 1 Scripts
# ============================================================================
# This file centralizes all environment-specific settings for the project.
# It allows scripts to be run in different environments without code changes.
#
# Note: It is critical to add this file to your .gitignore to prevent
# committing sensitive information like database passwords to version control.
# ============================================================================


[postgresql]
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section contains the connection details for your local PostgreSQL
# server. These settings are used by SQLAlchemy and Psycopg2 to connect to
# your databases.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server. For a local installation,
; this is almost always 'localhost'.
host = localhost

; The port number the PostgreSQL server is listening on. The default is 5432.
port = 5432

; The PostgreSQL user role that the scripts will use to connect.
; This user must have privileges to create new databases.
; The default superuser is 'postgres'.
user = postgres

; The password for the specified PostgreSQL user.
; THIS IS A SENSITIVE VALUE. Ensure this file is not tracked by Git.
password = __YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__

; The name of the root or default database on your server. The scripts will
; connect to this database initially in order to run CREATE DATABASE commands
; for the new legacy and benchmark databases. 'postgres' is the standard default.
root_db = postgres


[databases]
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section defines the names of all databases that the scripts will
# create, interact with, and profile. Using a list here makes the scripts
# easily extensible if another database is added later.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; A comma-separated list of the four legacy database names that will be
; created by the 00_setup_databases.py script.
legacy_dbs = TMP_DF8, TMP_DF9, TMP_DF10, TMP_REAN_DF2

; The name of the single legacy database that will be used as the source
; for creating the flattened, wide-format benchmark databases.
; As planned, TMP_DF9 is the most complex and therefore the best candidate.
benchmark_source_db = TMP_DF9

; A comma-separated list of the names for the two new benchmark databases
; that will be created by the 01_create_benchmark_dbs.py script.
benchmark_dbs = tmp_benchmark_wide_numeric, tmp_benchmark_wide_text


[paths]
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section defines the relative file paths to input and output
# directories and files.
# IMPORTANT: All paths are relative to the `src/` directory, as that is
# where the Python scripts will be executed from.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Path to the directory containing the source .sql dump files for the
; legacy databases.
sql_dump_dir = ../../../infrastructure/db/legacy_db_sql_scripts/

; Path to the .sql file that will contain the canonical queries used for
; performance benchmarking.
sql_benchmark_queries = ../sql/canonical_queries.sql

; Path to the output directory where generated ERD .svg files will be saved.
output_erds = ../outputs/erds/

; Path to the output directory where intermediate profiling metric
; files (.csv, .json) will be saved.
output_metrics = ../outputs/metrics/

; Path to the output directory where the final aggregated reports
; (.csv, .md) will be saved.
output_reports = ../outputs/reports/
