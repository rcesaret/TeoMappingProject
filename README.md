# üåê Digital TMP: Open Geospatial Integration of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project Data Files

> **Purpose:** A comprehensive modernization and digital integration initiative transforming the Teotihuacan Mapping Project‚Äôs legacy archaeological datasets into a unified, reproducible, and open-access geospatial research infrastructure, supporting both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

## üìå Overview

This project modernizes and unifies the legacy datasets of the **Teotihuacan Mapping Project (TMP)**, originally led by Ren√© Millon in the 1960s. The TMP represents the only full-surface archaeological survey ever conducted for the ancient city of Teotihuacan, encompassing over 5,000 surface collection units across approximately 37.5 square kilometers. Despite its legacy as the empirical foundation of decades of Mesoamerican research, the TMP dataset remains fragmented across obsolete file formats, incompatible schemas, and spatial systems that prevent integration with modern digital tools.

The Digital TMP Project executes a structured, eight-phase digital transformation pipeline that systematically converts analog archives and legacy software outputs into a unified PostgreSQL/PostGIS platform. The outcome is a modular, reproducible, and open-access geospatial database supporting SQL-based queries, modern GIS formats, and spatial analyses across artifact, architectural, and typological datasets.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Integrate Legacy Datasets**: Merge disparate TMP databases (DF8, DF9, DF10, REANS2) into a unified spatial database with schema harmonization and entity key alignment.
- **Complete Spatial Digitization**: Digitize and georeference all archaeological, environmental, and modern features from 1:2,000 TMP base maps using high-precision georeferencing workflows.
- **Ensure Data Quality and Validation**: Implement automated data quality frameworks to ensure robust, reliable, and reproducible datasets.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Develop structured metadata and detailed documentation to facilitate data interpretation and reuse.
- **Enable Open Access**: Publish the finalized spatial database through tDAR, interactive WebGIS platforms, and comprehensive tutorials for diverse user communities.
- **Support Future Research**: Provide high-quality spatial base layers for excavation planning, comparative urbanism studies, and integration with modern geophysical surveys.
- **Establish Extensible Infrastructure**: Create a scalable platform for integrating future TMP excavations, drone photogrammetry, and INAH archival datasets.
- **Enhance Digital Scholarship**: Produce curated datasets and reproducible workflows supporting teaching in archaeology, GIS, and digital humanities.

2. **Database Transformation** ‚Äì Comprehensive ETL and feature engineering to produce analysis-ready datasets.

### Spatial Data Creation (Phases 3-4)
3. **GIS Digitization** ‚Äì Manual digitization of archaeological, environmental, and modern features.
4. **Georeferencing** ‚Äì High-precision georeferencing using custom NTv2 transformations.

### Integration and Enhancement (Phase 5)
5. **Geospatial Integration** ‚Äì Integration of tabular and spatial data with advanced feature engineering.

### Preservation and Distribution (Phases 6-8)
6. **tDAR Outputs** ‚Äì Preparation and packaging of archival-ready datasets for long-term preservation.
7. **PostGIS Database** ‚Äì Design and deployment of production-grade spatial database.
8. **Tutorials & Dashboards** ‚Äì Development of user-facing applications and comprehensive tutorials.
