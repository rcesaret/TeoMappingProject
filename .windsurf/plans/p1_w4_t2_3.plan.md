## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W4.T2.3`:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#3.6.2`
    - [ ] Executed notebooks in `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/`
    - [ ] Existing draft `phases/01_LegacyDB/drafts/Phase1_WhitePaper_v2.md` (if any)
    - [ ] Outputs/reports and comparison visuals from previous workflows.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Collect key quantitative results from comparison report and analysis notebooks.
- [ ] Outline white paper sections based on `PLANNING_PHASE1.md#3.6.2`: 1. Executive Summary, 2. Introduction, 3. Methodology, 4. Results & Discussion (per database & comparative), 5. Architectural Recommendation for Phase 2, 6. Conclusion, Appendix (Optional).
- [ ] Establish target output path `phases/01_LegacyDB/drafts/Phase1_WhitePaper_v3.md`.

## Stage 3: Execution
- [ ] Create new markdown file from template or copy previous draft to `_v3.md`.
- [ ] Populate each section with synthesized conclusions, embedding plots/figures.
- [ ] Cite metric numbers and reference figures accurately.
- [ ] Run spell-check or markdown linter (e.g., `ruff` or `markdownlint`).

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm `phases/01_LegacyDB/drafts/Phase1_WhitePaper_v3.md` exists, renders correctly, and presents a complete, data-driven argument for the recommended Phase 2 architecture.
- [ ] Assert recommended architecture is clearly justified with data.
- [ ] Propose TASKS.md status update for P1.W4.T2.3 to `done`.
