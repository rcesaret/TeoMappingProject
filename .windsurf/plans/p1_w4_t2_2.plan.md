description: A systematic plan to create, execute, and validate the single comparative analysis notebook that synthesizes findings from the individual database analyses.

## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W4.T2.2`:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#4.8.3`
    - [ ] The new analysis notebook template: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/template_comparative_analysis.ipynb`.
    - [ ] The outputs from the previous task (`P1.W4.T2.1`), specifically the six executed `analysis_*.ipynb` notebooks in `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/`, which will serve as inputs for this task.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Identify the source template file path: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/template_comparative_analysis.ipynb`.
- [ ] Define the target deliverable file path: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_comparative.ipynb`.
- [ ] Confirm that all six required input notebooks from task `P1.W4.T2.1` exist and contain outputs.

## Stage 3: Creation & Execution
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_comparative.ipynb`.
- [ ] Read the full content of the `template_comparative_analysis.ipynb` and write it into the new `analysis_comparative.ipynb` file.
- [ ] Execute the `analysis_comparative.ipynb` notebook from the first cell to the last. This notebook is expected to load data from the previous six analysis notebooks or their outputs.
- [ ] Verify that the notebook execution completed without any errors reported in the output cells.
- [ ] Save the executed `analysis_comparative.ipynb` notebook, ensuring all cell outputs and plots are included.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Verify that the `analysis_comparative.ipynb` file has been created in the target directory and contains cell outputs.
- [ ] Specifically, review the notebook's output to confirm that the final "comparative radar plot" has been successfully generated and rendered, as per the `validation_steps` in `TASKS.md`.
- [ ] Review all `validation_steps` for task `P1.W4.T2.2` in `TASKS.md` and confirm all criteria are met.
- [ ] Propose the required changes to `TASKS.md` to update the status of task `P1.W4.T2.2` to `done`.
