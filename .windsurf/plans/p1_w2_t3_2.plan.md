## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W2.T3.2`:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#Testing-Strategy-for-Profiling-Pipeline-Orchestrator`
    - [ ] The target scripts `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/02_run_profiling_pipeline.py` & `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/03_generate_erds.py`
    - [ ] Any existing logs in `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/`.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Confirm prerequisite unit tests (P1.W2.T3.1) pass.
- [ ] Set up temp directories and mock DB fixtures to isolate orchestrators.
- [ ] Determine expected files/side-effects for both scripts.

## Stage 3: Execution
- [ ] Author `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/test_02_run_profiling_pipeline.py` validating:
      • pipeline completes without error
      • ~40 metric files generated in the correct output directory.
- [ ] Author `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/test_03_generate_erds.py` validating exactly nine SVGs are generated in the correct output directory.
- [ ] Use `monkeypatch`/`pytest-mock` to stub heavy DB calls if needed.
- [ ] Run `pytest phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/` until all integration tests pass.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm both test suites (`test_02_run_profiling_pipeline.py`, `test_03_generate_erds.py`) exist in `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/`, all tests pass, and achieve 100% coverage (if feasible, otherwise document why not).
- [ ] Confirm generated files cleaned or in `.gitignore` as appropriate.
- [ ] Propose TASKS.md status update for P1.W2.T3.2 to `done`.
