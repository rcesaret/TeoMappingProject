## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W3.T2.1`:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#4.6.3` (especially subsections on Execution Protocol and Validation)
    - [ ] The target script `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/04_run_comparison.py`
    - [ ] Any existing logs in `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/`.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Ensure aggregated metric inputs (~40 metric files from `phases/01_LegacyDB/outputs/metrics/`) exist.
- [ ] Activate env (`conda run -n digital_tmp_base`).
- [ ] Verify/prepare `phases/01_LegacyDB/outputs/reports/` directory.

## Stage 3: Execution
- [ ] Run `conda run -n digital_tmp_base python phases/01_LegacyDB/src/04_run_comparison.py`.
- [ ] Redirect stdout/stderr to `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/04_run_comparison.log`.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm `comparison_matrix.csv` and `comparison_report.md` are generated in `phases/01_LegacyDB/outputs/reports/`.
- [ ] Spot-check content of both output files for correctness as per `PLANNING_PHASE1.md#4.6.3.4`.
- [ ] Confirm log `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/04_run_comparison.log` indicates "Comparison report generation complete." and no errors/warnings.
- [ ] Propose TASKS.md status update for P1.W3.T2.1 to `done`.
