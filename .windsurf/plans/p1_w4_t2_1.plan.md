# Plan: Execute Individual Analysis Notebooks
tags: [coding, scripting, execution, validation, jupyter]
task_id: P1.W4.T2.1
description: A systematic plan to create, execute, and validate the six individual database analysis notebooks as specified in TASKS.md.

## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W4.T2.1`:
	- [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#4.7.3`
    - [ ] The analysis notebook template: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/template_individual_db_analysis.ipynb`.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Define the list of six target database names for analysis: `['tmp_df8', 'tmp_df9', 'tmp_df10', 'tmp_rean_df2', 'benchmark_df9', 'benchmark_df10']`.
- [ ] Identify the source template file path: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/template_individual_db_analysis.ipynb`.
- [ ] Identify the target directory for deliverables: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/`.

## Stage 3: Creation & Execution Loop

### For database: `tmp_df8`
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_tmp_df8.ipynb`.
- [ ] Read the full content of the template notebook and write it into the new `analysis_tmp_df8.ipynb` file.
- [ ] In `analysis_tmp_df8.ipynb`, find the line `db_name = 'placeholder'` and replace it with `db_name = 'tmp_df8'`.
- [ ] Execute the `analysis_tmp_df8.ipynb` notebook from the first cell to the last.
- [ ] Verify that the notebook execution completed without any errors reported in the output cells.
- [ ] Save the executed `analysis_tmp_df8.ipynb` notebook, ensuring all cell outputs and plots are included.

### For database: `tmp_df9`
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_tmp_df9.ipynb`.
- [ ] Repeat the process: Copy template content, set `db_name = 'tmp_df9'`, execute, verify, and save.

### For database: `tmp_df10`
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_tmp_df10.ipynb`.
- [ ] Repeat the process: Copy template content, set `db_name = 'tmp_df10'`, execute, verify, and save.

### For database: `tmp_rean_df2`
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_tmp_rean_df2.ipynb`.
- [ ] Repeat the process: Copy template content, set `db_name = 'tmp_rean_df2'`, execute, verify, and save.

### For database: `benchmark_df9`
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_benchmark_df9.ipynb`.
- [ ] Repeat the process: Copy template content, set `db_name = 'benchmark_df9'`, execute, verify, and save.

### For database: `benchmark_df10`
- [ ] Create the new notebook file: `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/analysis_benchmark_df10.ipynb`.
- [ ] Repeat the process: Copy template content, set `db_name = 'benchmark_df10'`, execute, verify, and save.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] List the contents of the `phases/01_LegacyDB/notebooks/` directory and verify that all six `analysis_*.ipynb` files have been created.
- [ ] Confirm that each of the six notebooks is not empty and contains cell outputs, including rendered plots.
- [ ] Review the `validation_steps` for task `P1.W4.T2.1` in `TASKS.md` and confirm all specified criteria are met.
- [ ] Propose the required changes to `TASKS.md` to update the status of task `P1.W4.T2.1` to `done`.
