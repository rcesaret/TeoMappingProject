## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present task and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#4.5.3`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/03_generate_erds.py`
    - [ ] Any existing ERD outputs/logs.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Ensure prerequisite metric files and databases exist.
- [ ] Activate env with `conda run -n digital_tmp_base`.
- [ ] Verify/prepare `phases/01_LegacyDB/outputs/erds/` directory.

## Stage 3: Execution
- [ ] Execute:
      `conda run -n digital_tmp_base python phases/01_LegacyDB/src/03_generate_erds.py`.
- [ ] Capture stdout/stderr to `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/03_generate_erds.log`.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm that exactly nine `.svg` files are generated in `phases/01_LegacyDB/outputs/erds/` and that each is > 0 bytes.
- [ ] Confirm log `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/03_generate_erds.log` contains "ERD generation complete for all databases." and no errors.
- [ ] Propose TASKS.md status update for P1.W2.T2.2 to `done`.
