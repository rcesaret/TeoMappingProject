## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W1.T4.2`:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#Testing-Strategy-for-01_create_benchmark_dbs.py`
    - [ ] The target script `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/01_create_benchmark_dbs.py`
    - [ ] Any existing logs in `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/`.

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Locate script under test and identify external resources (config, SQL files).
- [ ] Define pytest fixture to spin up a temporary PostgreSQL DB or use mocks.
- [ ] Determine expected side-effects: two benchmark DBs with populated tables.

## Stage 3: Execution
- [ ] Author `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w1/test_01_create_benchmark_dbs.py` covering happy path and edge cases.
- [ ] Run `pytest phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w1/test_01_create_benchmark_dbs.py` until all tests pass.
- [ ] Capture stdout/stderr; ensure no unhandled exceptions.

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w1/test_01_create_benchmark_dbs.py` exists and `pytest` reports 100% pass rate (document if 100% coverage is not feasible).
- [ ] Verify created DBs if using real DB; otherwise assert mocks called correctly.
- [ ] Propose TASKS.md status update for P1.W1.T4.2 to `done`.
