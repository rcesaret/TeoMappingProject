description: Implement and pass unit tests for the seven profiling modules.

## Stage 1: Context Ingestion & Verification
- [ ] **Global Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following core project files to ensure full alignment with project standards:
    - [ ] `README.md` (root)
    - [ ] `PLANNING.md`
    - [ ] `TASKS.md`
	- [ ] `docs/overview.md`
    - [ ] `docs/architecture.md`
    - [ ] The complete rule suite in the `.windsurf/rules/` directory.
- [ ] **Phase-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the present phase and workflow context:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/README.md`
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md`
- [ ] **Task-Specific Context Review:** Exhaustively review the following files to understand the specific requirements of task `P1.W2.T3.1`:
    - [ ] `phases/01_LegacyDB/PLANNING_PHASE1.md#Per-Module-Test-Plan`
    - [ ] Each module in `phases/01_LegacyDB/src/profiling_modules/`
    - [ ] Any existing fixtures or helper scripts

## Stage 2: Preparation
- [ ] Identify the seven modules to test; list their public functions/classes.
- [ ] Design pytest fixtures using a small temporary or mocked PostgreSQL
      database populated with representative data.
- [ ] Decide coverage targets (happy-path, edge-case, error handling) for each
      module.

## Stage 3: Execution
- [ ] Create test files in `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/` following naming convention `test_<module_name>.py` (e.g., `test_db_size_profiler.py`).
- [ ] Implement tests, leveraging fixtures and asserting expected outputs or
      exceptions.
- [ ] Run `pytest phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/` iteratively until all tests pass and achieve 100% coverage (if feasible, otherwise document why not).

## Stage 4: Final Validation & Cleanup
- [ ] Confirm `pytest` run exit code 0 and all tests green.
- [ ] Confirm all 7 test suites (e.g., `test_db_size_profiler.py`) exist in `phases/01_LegacyDB/tests/p1_w2/`, all tests pass, and coverage target is met/documented.
- [ ] Propose TASKS.md status update for P1.W2.T3.1 to `done`.
