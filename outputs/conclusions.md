# 📘 Project Conclusions & Reflections

> **Purpose**: Summarize what was learned, what matters, and what’s next. Ideal for portfolio use or as a final report section.

## ✅ Summary of Findings
Brief recap of major outcomes:
- Created a multi-source geospatial database
- Digitized and aligned zoning layers
- Successfully integrated spatial and tabular datasets

> _Tip_: Use 3–5 bullet points to summarize "What did we accomplish?"

## 🔍 Insights & Impacts
What insights emerged?
- Spatial clustering of low-access zones
- Correlation between infrastructure density and equity scores
- Better accuracy than existing planning maps

## 📌 Deliverables
- PostGIS database (3 validated layers)
- Final feature-rich CSVs
- EDA and modeling notebooks
- Project documentation

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Incomplete coverage in zoning maps (1980s)
- Manual digitization prone to georeferencing error
- Assumes static infrastructure locations (not time-aware)

## ⏭️ Future Work
- Automate GIS digitization via OCR or AI
- Incorporate time-series zoning data
- Deploy web viewer (e.g., via Leaflet + Flask)

## 💼 Portfolio Context
This project demonstrates:
- Multi-language data science (Python + R)
- Spatial data engineering
- Reproducible workflows
- Practical application of research methods in industry-relevant tooling

> _Optional_: Add link to a blog post, slide deck, or portfolio site.
